# Craedl Desktop Application

The Craedl Desktop Application enables Craedl users to synchronize directories
on their local system to projects in their [Craedl](https://craedl.org) account.
This provides a quick mechanism for syncing data to Craedl from dynamic
directories.

## Quick start

Get started with the Craedl Desktop Application by obtaining the correct package
for your operating system [here](https://craedl.org/project/4116589?d=4116593).

After downloading the package, extract the contents of the zip and run the
executable file `craedl-desktop` by double-clicking on it or by accessing it
via the system shell.

Log into your Craedl account at [Craedl.org](https://craedl.org) and generate an
API access token by clicking the key icon in the `My Craedl` card. Copy your
token and paste it when prompted after opening the application.

Now you can choose a local directory (e.g. `C:\Users\Eric\craedl-desktop\packages`)
and a Craedl URL (e.g. `https://craedl.org/project/4116589`) into which the
directory will be synchronized. A project URL will sync the folder into the root
directory. A directory URL (e.g. `https://craedl.org/project/4116589?d=4116593`)
will sync the folder into that directory.
